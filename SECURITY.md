## Reporting a Vulnerability

While the nature of Minecraft plugins within servers usually do not warrant a serious security issue, I want to make available a method for reaching out securely should there be an issue. For any and all security related issues please go to https://zachduda.com/contact and fill out the form there detailing everything. All messages are encrypted both in transit and in storage with my private key automatically.
